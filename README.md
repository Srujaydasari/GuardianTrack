# GuardianTrack â€“ Android Background Location Tracker

GuardianTrack is an Android app that continuously tracks GPS location every 1 minute in the background and uploads the data (timestamp, latitude, longitude) to a Google Sheet via Google Apps Script. The service persists even when the screen is off or the app is removed from recent tasks.
